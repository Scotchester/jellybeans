# A Boy and His Beans

A simple website cataloguing my reviews of one of my favorite classes of candy:
jelly beans.

View the site at [jellybeans.lol](http://jellybeans.lol)


## To run the site locally

You'll need Jekyll and some related dependencies to run locally.
These can be installed with Bundler by running the following commands
from the root of the project:

```sh
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Once that's done, to have Jekyll compile the site and start a server, run:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

Open it up in your browser: <http://localhost:4000/>
