Like three of the first four reviews on this site,
and like several more to come, this is another collection
of jelly beans being put out by an established candy brand.

The original SweeTarts are a long-standing favorite candy of mine,
along with many of their offshoots (gummy, sour chewy, etc.).
SweeTarts Jelly Beans definitely do right by the brand.
Let's see how they rate.


## Size and shape

This is the weakest category for SweeTarts Jelly Beans;
it's all uphill from here.

Bean size and shape are wildly inconsistent, much like the
[Swedish Fish Jelly Beans](/swedish-fish-jelly-beans#size-and-shape).
Average size is just a _little_ bit under what I'd prefer.
I can see evidence of attempting to add a dimple on some beans,
but the results aren't impressive.

**1 out of 5 beans**


## Chewability

I can find no fault with the chewability of these jelly beans.
The shell has just the right amount of give,
and the insides don't collapse too quickly.

**5 out of 5 beans**


## Texture

SweeTarts Jelly Beans achieve another perfect subcategory score here.
The shell breaks down at exactly the right pace.
It goes from fully intact before the first bite,
to medium-sized hunks on initial breakup,
to finishing as a fine powder that evokes the texture of
an original SweeTart in its final stages of chewing.

These beans are a triumph of jelly bean texture.

## Taste and flavor

        <li>:grapes: Grape</li>

    </ul>
</div>

As with [Nerds Bumpy Jelly Beans](/nerds-bumpy-jelly-beans#taste-and-flavor),
SweeTarts Jelly Beans decline to specify their intended flavors.
Like the Nerds, some of them are obvious, but several of them are not.
The pink bean resembles several small red fruits,
and blue and green are entirely impossible to figure out.

(I am trusting the accuracy of the
[Wikipedia entry on SweeTarts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SweeTarts#Flavors)
to fill out the mystery flavors in the sidebar over there :point_right:)

Questionable flavors aside, the taste of these beans is a very accurate
representation of the original SweeTarts flavors.
True to their name, they have distinct sweet and tart aspects to their taste,
with the insides being sweet and the shells bringing the tartness
as they break down into that fine powder I described earlier
(which bears some resemblance to Pixy Stix, another childhood favorite[^1]).

SweeTarts may not bring the most true-to-life fruit flavors to the table,
but they are very tasty, nonetheless.

**8 out of 10 beans**


## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^2]

A handful of each flavor of SweeTarts Jelly Beans is a delightful experience.
The quantity is easy to handle, thanks to their
appropriate bean size and perfect chewability.
The flavors mesh very well together, and having six at once really
highlights the tart aspect of the flavor, which is the side I'm
naturally more drawn to.

**10 out of 10 beans**


## Conclusion

And just like that, we have a new top scorer!
SweeTarts Jelly Beans have been a favorite of mine for many years,
and I highly recommend that you check them out and add them to your
list annual Easter season jelly bean purchases.

[^1]: _After_ writing this comment about their resemblance to Pixy Stix, I read the introduction to the [SweeTarts Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SweeTarts), which claims that they were actually created from the same basic recipe as Pixy Stix. Brilliant!

[^2]: This test is specific to fruit flavors _only_. While non-fruit flavors like licorice or buttered popcorn may be welcome, they are exempt from this test. Because that's just nasty.
