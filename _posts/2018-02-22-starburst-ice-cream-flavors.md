Next up to bat, another variety of a very popular brand of jelly beans:
Starburst's Ice Cream Flavors.

In the technical categories, I expect results consistent with my previous
reviews of Starburst jelly beans ([Original](/starburst-jelly-beans),
[Crazy Beans](/starburst-crazy-beans), and [Sour](/starburst-sour-jelly-beans)).

Though this doesn't officially affect any scores,
I must note for the record that there was only a dozen, at most,
orange beans in this bag. Given that there are only four flavors,
this is _far_ under the roughly 1-in-4 proportion that it should be.

On to the review.


## Size and shape

No surprises here. I still think they're slightly small,
but on the whole, Starburst consistently does well in this category.

**4 out of 5 beans**


## Chewability

Starburst consistently does well in size and shape,
but they consistently _knock it out of the park_ in chewability.
For the fourth time, a bag of Starburst beans
is awarded a perfect subscore in this category.

**5 out of 5 beans**


## Texture

In the most recent Starburst Jelly Beans review,
[I demoted their texture score to 3](/starburst-sour-jelly-beans#texture),
on account of the shell being too grainy on breakup.
That must've been a phenomenon isolated to that bag or that variety,
because I don't have that problem with these Ice Cream beans,
and I didn't have it with the first two varieties.
These beans are equally deserving of the 4 I gave to those first two.

**4 out of 5 beans**


## Taste and flavor

<div class="inset">
    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:strawberry: Strawberry</li>
        <li>:orange: Orange Sherbet</li>
        <li>:heart: Red Raspberry</li>
        <li>:lemon: Lemon Sorbet</li>
    </ul>
</div>

And now we're on to the meat of this review.

Starburst has always done well, if not excelled,
in the taste and flavor category,
so I was looking forward to seeing what they did with
some less-conventional flavors. The funny thing is,
I never read the actual bean flavors when buying the bag,
and I was disappointed to realize that three out of four of these Flavors
are just variants on classic Starburst flavors.

Still, they taste good, and they made a solid effort
to make them actually resemble ice cream, sherbet, or sorbet.
They have a bit of milkiness to them.
I feel like I pick up a bit of coconut in the strawberry,
but there doesn't appear to be any coconut derivatives in the ingredients.
Not being a fan of coconut, this is a slight turnoff,
but I understand how it adds to the "ice cream" effect of the flavor.

I think this is a first for a review here:
I'm going to dock a bean for the fact that the colors of the strawberry
and red raspberry beans are so close that they're indistinguishable
without taking a very close look.
This is pretty annoying when you're trying to reach for a specific flavor.
And we're not talking [Gimbal's 41 flavors](/gimbals-gourmet-jelly-beans) here.
There are _four flavors_ in this bag.
Coulda made just a little more effort there, Starburst.

**6 out of 10 beans**


## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

Four beans on the smaller side never fill the mouth as much as I would like,
but the flavors complement each other very well,
and Starburst's stellar chewability makes for an effortless test.
There's a good balance of acidity from the lemon sorbet and red raspberry
and creaminess from the orange sherbet and strawberry.

**8 out of 10 beans**


## Conclusion

Category         | Score
---------------- | ---------------
Size and shape   | **4**/5 beans
Chewability      | **5**/5 beans
Texture          | **4**/5 beans
Taste and flavor | **6**/10 beans
One-of-each test | **8**/10 beans
---------------- | ---------------
_Total_          | **27**/35 beans

Another solid effort by Starburst.
Most likely, I'd reach for the Originals or the Sours before these,
but a lot of that is my personal bias toward acidity.
This is a unique, if modestly so, bag that any jelly bean lover should try.

[^1]: This test is specific to fruit flavors _only_. While non-fruit flavors like licorice or buttered popcorn may be welcome, they are exempt from this test. Because that's just nasty.
