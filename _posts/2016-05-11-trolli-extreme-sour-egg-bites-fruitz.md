We are gathered here today to review what is almost certainly
the jelly bean brand with the wordiest name that we will ever encounter:
Trolli Extreme Sour Egg Bites Fruitz.

What's mildly interesting is that these beans appear to be nothing more
than a themed rebadging of Trolli's more prevalent
[Extreme Sour Bites Fruitz](http://www.weirdlyawesome.com/products#candy1),
throwing "Egg" in the name to make them vaguely Eastery.

Also of note: neither the word "jelly" nor the word "beans" appears on the
packaging, though they seem clearly designed to be interpreted as jelly beans
by the Easter candy-buying public.

Enough intro; let's get on with the review.


## Size and shape

The average size of these jelly beans – _Should I stop referring to them
as jelly beans, since the manufacturer does not?_ – is just about right;
maybe a _hair_ on the small side.
Variance is small; no beans are abnormally small or large.

The shape of these candies is not very bean like,
but I'm not sure it's fair to dock points for that.
In fact, the shape _is_ pretty egg-like, with the size tapering toward one
end of the candies and no sharp edges in sight.
I have to think they accomplished what they set out to accomplish.

**4 out of 5 beans**


## Chewability

Trolli Extreme Sour Egg Bites Fruitz chew very easily.
Breaking through the shell takes just the right amount of force.
The insides may be a little bit _too_ easy to chew,
especially if you are only chewing a single one of them.

**4 out of 5 beans**


## Texture

This is one of the harder categories to rate when reviewing the Trolli bites.
The texture isn't a very traditional jelly bean texture.
It reminds me most of a bubble gum that has a shell,
actually – the insides feel sorta stretchy.
They dissolve in your mouth fairly quickly, though,
unlike a piece of bubble gum.

It's definitely unconventional from a traditional jelly bean standpoint,
but it doesn't bother me significantly.

**3 out of 5 beans**


## Taste and flavor

        <li>:green_apple: Sour Green Apple</li>
        <li>:watermelon: Sour Watermelon</li>
        <li>:lemon: Sour Citrus</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Trolli Extreme Sour Egg Bites Fruitz only come in four flavors,
but they are all excellent representation of the flavors they purport to be[^1].

The sourness is perhaps not as **XTREEM** as advertised,
but it's more than adequate, and in fact is significantly more sour than the
disappointing [Sour Patch Jelly Beans](/sour-patch-jelly-beans).

Overall, I was very pleased with the taste of these candies.
My only disappointment is that there isn't one or two more flavors.

**9 out of 10 beans**


## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^2]

As with the Sour Patch beans, having four candies in the mouth simultaneously
increases the perceived sourness a fair bit,
perhaps even approaching _extreme sour_ status.
The flavors complement each other well, and the added quantity improves on
the somewhat weak chewiness of a single bean.

Still, again as with the Sour Patch Jelly Beans,
having only four beans seems a little inadequate.

**8 out of 10 beans**

I've heard a [film critic](https://twitter.com/AnnHornaday) say
that she never knows how she really feels about a film
until she starts writing her review.
I feel similarly about these reviews.
I know generally how I feel about a bag of beans, but until I start writing,
I'm never really sure how the ratings will turn out.

I knew I enjoyed these beans quite a lot, but I was pretty surprised
to get to the end of this review and find that they had overtaken
[Starburst Jelly Beans](/starburst-jelly-beans) for the second place ranking,
finishing just one bean behind the all-time leader,
[SweeTarts](/sweetarts-jelly-beans)!

I'm still slightly uncomfortable with the fact that these aren't marketed as
jelly beans, and the fact that their internal texture is very non-traditional.
Perhaps the rating will get an asterisk somewhere down the road,
but for now, this review stands as written.

[^1]: Disclosure: I have never actually tried the fruit of the [_Rubus leucodermis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_leucodermis) plant, and can not truthfully speak to how well the blue raspberry flavor represents it.

[^2]: This test is specific to fruit flavors _only_. While non-fruit flavors like licorice or buttered popcorn may be welcome, they are exempt from this test. Because that's just nasty.
