Welcome to the ninth season of reviews here on <cite>A Boy and His Beans</cite>!
As noted at the end of last season, they're getting increasingly short.
I'll have five reviews for you here over the next eight days,
kicking off with this review from the Wakarusa Dime Store.

My friends Daniel and Rebecca recently moved to northern Indiana,
and they came across this store in the nearby town of Wakarusa,
which claims that its jumbo jelly beans are world famous!
While I have to admit that I had never heard of them,
I have to give them credit for leaning so hard into this claim
that they secured [jumbojellybeans.com](https://www.jumbojellybeans.com/)
as the domain name for their website.

Many thanks to Daniel for sending a bag of these beans for me to review!


## Size and shape

When reviewing a jumbo jelly bean, one goes into it knowing that
the size component of this category will necessarily be
judged differently from most other jelly beans.
This is fine; it just means evaluating size in comparison to
the other jumbos reviewed in the past.

These beans are, on average, the largest I've ever reviewed,
clocking in at maybe 20% bigger than
[the Howe Jumbo Jelly Beans I reviewed on this day last year](/howe-jumbo-jelly-beans).
That makes them just a bit too big for my liking.

They make a solid effort at being bean-shaped,
and consistency in both areas is strong.

## Chewability

These beans walk right up to the line of ideal toughness
and dance delicately around it.
A few outliers cross the line, but none are ever too soft.
That's about as good as you can ask for!

## Texture

Brach's doesn't have particularly high standards for shell smoothness,
and the shell doesn't chunk up very nicely, either,
but the insides are quite nice.
There's no unpleasant grittiness to be found here at all.

## Taste and flavor

<div class="inset">
    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:fr: :chocolate_bar: Chocolate Macaron</li>
        <li>:jp: :strawberry: Strawberry Mochi</li>
        <li>:mexico: :baguette_bread: Churro</li>
        <li>:it: :lemon: Lemon Sorbet</li>
        <li>:us: :green_apple: Apple Pie</li>
    </ul>
</div>

The first thing that jumps out here is that Brach's was able to re-use the
churro flavor the [Late Night Taco Truck Jelly Beans](/brachs-taco-truck).
It works as well this year as it did last, which is just fine.

The biggest disappointment, by a wide margin, is the Apple Pie jelly bean.
It is almost entirely devoid of apple flavor,
seemingly attempting to get by on nothing more than its baking spice elements.
It's a big disappointment for a big apple pie fan.

The other three beans are the most successful.
In each case, Brach's has not been content to just pull a stock flavor
for the primary element involved, but has clearly tweaked things
to incorporate the specific medium through which it is delivered.

It's hard to put into words exactly how, but
Lemon Sorbet manages to clearly capture not just a raw lemon flavor,
but also the sorbet aspect.
Strawberry Mochi has a bit of lactose to it that evokes the ice cream.
Finally, Chocolate Macaron somehow manages to evoke the baked cookie goodness
of the classic French confection.

It's a pretty delightful assortment of tasty flavors
that can transport you to the different countries represented,
if you're in the right frame of mind.

**7 out of 10 beans**


## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

Despite the desserts that inspired these five beans
having a pretty wide range of flavor,
these all work remarkably well together in a single mouthful.
Apple Pie is the one that is most easily lost,
with the Churro bean doing the same kind of work as the crusty part of the pie,
but the others are easy to pick out.
Another minor issue is that,
while they might have near-perfect individual chewability,
five of those all taken together can be a little much.

**7 out of 10 beans**


## Conclusion

Brach's continues it's run of posting respectable scores,
as long as we're talking about their beans, not bird eggs,
and not talking about their regrettable experiments with savory flavors.

Category         | Score
---------------- | ---------------
Size and shape   | **2**/5 beans
Chewability      | **5**/5 beans
Texture          | **3**/5 beans
Taste and flavor | **7**/10 beans
One-of-each test | **7**/10 beans
---------------- | ---------------
_Total_          | **24**/35 beans
