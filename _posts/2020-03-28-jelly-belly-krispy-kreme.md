The world's best-known jelly bean brand is back on
<cite>A Boy and His Beans</cite> with another package that
leverages the name and flavors of a different food and beverage brand:
Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.

I am not the world's biggest Krispy Kreme fan,
but I have definitely enjoyed the experience of going into one of their stores
at a time when they were actively producing doughnuts,
plucking a doughnut right off the conveyor that comes into
the retail area of the store, and enjoying it while it's hot and fresh.

I'm definitely interested to see how well these beans replicate that flavor.

As with other recent Jelly Belly reviews, they are so amazingly consistent
with their size, shape, chewability, and texture that I will refer you
to some past Jelly Belly reviews
([Snapple](/jelly-belly-snapple),
[Sours](/jelly-belly-sours), and
[Soda Pop Shoppe](/jelly-belly-soda-pop-shoppe))
for details on those categories.

(Left off that list is the most recent Jelly Belly review I did,
their [Justice League](/jelly-belly-justice-league) package,
which had identical size, shape, and chewability,
but a bit of a different texture,
due to the attempt to make them "sparkling" flavors.)

## Taste and flavor

<div class="inset">
    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:doughnut: Original Glazed</li>
        <li>:chocolate_bar: Chocolate Iced with Sprinkles</li>
        <li>:apple: Cinnamon Apple Filled</li>
        <li>:strawberry: Strawberry Iced</li>
        <li>:cake: Glazed Blueberry Cake</li>
    </ul>
</div>

I don't know how they do it, but these beans really do taste like doughnuts.
The Original Glazed flavor does indeed capture the taste of the classic
Krispy Kreme doughnut, though it's a little bit odd to be tasting it
in such a dense package, compared to how light and airy the actual doughnut is.

I'll be honest, I'm not sure I've ever eaten any _other_ type of doughnut
from Krispy Kreme, but all of the flavors do taste doughnutty.
The Strawberry Iced bean tastes as I imagine the classic Krispy Kreme doughnut
with strawberry icing would taste.
The chocolate flavor of the Chocolate Iced with Sprinkles bean
is not the world's best chocolate flavor, but it passes.

The final two beans I've yet to mention, Cinnamon Apple Filled and
Glazed Blueberry Cake, are the weakest.
The blueberry flavor is barely there, and the apple can't be tasted at all.
But both still somehow retain that glazed doughnut aspect to them,
so that's a partial success at least.

I remain somewhat impressed at the ability to mimic the taste of a doughnut,
but I can't imagine eating a normal-sized bag of these.
I was glad that I only bought a few small Easter-basket-sized boxes of them,
because otherwise a lot would be going to waste.

**4 out of 10 beans**


## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

Normally, I would only do this for fruit flavors (see above footnote),
but in this case, all these flavors are of a piece so I'll give it a go.

Yeah, that's not very good. It all ends up tasting like
the Basic Original Glazed flavor, with a hint of the chocolate and cinnamon
aspects of those two beans.
The strawberry and blueberry flavors are entirely masked
(and the apple was undetectable, to begin with).

It's not a _bad_ taste, but it certainly doesn't enhance anything
to eat all five flavors together.
And, as with previous Jelly Belly reviews, this category again takes a hit
due to their sub-par chewability.

**4 out of 10 beans**


## Conclusion

Jelly Belly continues to be aggressively mediocre
when it comes to their partnerships with other brands.
That said, I'm looking forward to trying another of their organic varieties
for my next Jelly Belly review.
Stay tuned for that before the season is out!

[^1]: This test is specific to fruit flavors _only_. While non-fruit flavors like licorice or buttered popcorn may be welcome, they are exempt from this test. Because that's just nasty.
