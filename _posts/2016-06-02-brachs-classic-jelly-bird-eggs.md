Live from Amtrak's [Empire Builder](https://www.amtrak.com/empire-builder-train)
line, somewhere in North Dakota, it's the next jelly bean review from
_A Boy and His Beans_!

As a friend told me when he brought some of these beans to me for review,
Brach's Classic Jelly Bird Eggs are the kind of jelly beans that
remind you of Easter lunch at grandma's house.
There's a certain "old world" quality to them.

Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Let's find out.


## Size and shape

Brach's "bird eggs" are a bit large for my liking,
but the average size is pretty consistent.

They're almost as large as the
[Russell Stover beans](/russell-stover-pectin-jelly-beans),
volume-wise, but their shape quality is not even close to those.
Whereas the Russell Stovers had a near-perfect bean shape,
the Brach's beans are most commonly a sort of rounded trapezoidal shape.

**1 out of 5 beans**


## Chewability

Chewing a Brach's Jelly Bird Egg is a good experience.
The shell gives with the right amount of force,
and the insides remind me of a fluffy pillow.
It could be juuust a bit chewier, so I'll dock one bean from this subscore.

**4 out of 5 beans**


## Texture

The shell gets unacceptably gritty when breaking up.
That grittiness overpowers the insides so much that I can't get a read on
the texture of the insides at all. Not good.

**1 out of 5 beans**


## Taste and flavor

<div class="inset">
    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:pineapple: Pineapple</li>
        <li>:lemon: Lemon</li>
        <li>:tennis: Lime</li>
        <li>:tangerine: Orange</li>
        <li>:strawberry: Strawberry</li>
        <li>:cherries: Cherry</li>
        <li>:grapes: Grape</li>
        <li>:wavy_dash: Licorice</li>
    </ul>
</div>

I'll get right to the point: These jelly beans do not taste good.
The flavors are not labeled, so I took my best guess at them,
but the fruit flavors barely resemble actual fruit.

The cherry and grape flavors are notably offensive,
as they both have a distinct cough syrup taste to them.

One bright spot is the inclusion of licorice.
Finally, 10 reviews in, the first bag of jelly beans that
include that classic flavor! Two beans earned just for that.

**2 out of 10 beans**


## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

This section ought to be pretty predictable, given the previous scores.

Seven beans that are too large + bad texture + terrible flavors =

**0 out of 10 beans**


## Conclusion

Category         | Score
---------------- | ---------------
Size and shape   | **1**/5 beans
Chewability      | **4**/5 beans
Texture          | **1**/5 beans
Taste and flavor | **2**/10 beans
One-of-each test | **0**/10 beans
---------------- | ---------------
_Total_          | **8**/35 beans

_Ouch._

Brach's Classic Jelly Bird Eggs may have a decent nostalgia factor,
but they don't hold up in 2016, taking the last place crown
from [Swedish Fish Jelly Beans](/swedish-fish-jelly-beans) by two beans.

To add insult to injury, they come in a full 1 lb. bag,
several ounces more than the previous largest bag.
That's a lot of beans I'm going to be leaving
in the trash can of this train car.

[^1]: This test is specific to fruit flavors _only_. While non-fruit flavors like licorice or buttered popcorn may be welcome, they are exempt from this test. Because that's just nasty.
