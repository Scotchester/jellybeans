I'm going to break from the conventional review format today,
because I just can't even with this crap.
Life's too short.

Not unexpectedly, Brach's Speckled Jelly Bird Eggs are just as bad as
[the "Classic" variety](/brachs-classic-jelly-bird-eggs).
The flavors may be slightly different, but it's not enough to move the
needle of the bean-o-meter.

The best thing I can say about these is that they look more like bird eggs
than the Classic variety.

I'm really hoping that the Brach's brand can redeem itself
when I get into its non-bird-egg-style jelly beans,
but that's all I've got for today.
Hopefully I'll have a more enlightening,
or at least more entertaining, review for you tomorrow.

_Fin._
