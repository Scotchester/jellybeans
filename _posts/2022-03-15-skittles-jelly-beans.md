One of the marquee new jelly bean releases for 2022
comes from another classic candy brand: Skittles!
I was a pretty big fan of Skittles as a kid,
but I've really not had them often as an adult.
They're a quintessential Halloween candy,
but not something I would pick up on a whim to satisfy a needy sweet tooth.

Skittles themselves are pretty close to jelly beans,
though they are a big chewier.
It'll be interesting to see how the beans differ from the originals.

I conducted this review in the company of my dear friend of over 30 years,
best man at my wedding, and a fellow connoisseur of sweets, Daniel C. Hodges.
I'll sprinkle his observations throughout.
Thanks for the assistance, Daniel!


## Size and shape

We start off not with a bang, but more of a sad trombone,
as the Skittles jelly beans do not make a good first impression.
They were extremely inconsistent, with no attempt made at a proper bean shape.
It's an interesting contrast to classic Skittles,
which (in my memory, at least)
are one of the most physically consistent candies I've encountered.

I really enjoyed this analogy that Daniel came up with:
"It's like seeing a bunch of beanbags floating around in zero gravity –
each is vaguely spherical and oblong,
but there's a huge range of sizes, protrusions, and dents."

He then had the clever idea to break out his calipers
and measure the largest and smallest beans we could find.
On the longer axis, the largest bean we could find was 17.64 mm long
and the smallest bean was a mere 12.39 mm.
That makes the largest bean over 42% larger than the smallest!

## Chewability

This category went much better for the Skittles beans,
as they were slightly easier than average to chew,
from my own experience writing these reviews.
On the other hand, Daniel said he found them to be
slightly harder to chew than he expected, but not in a bad way.
I actually would have liked them to offer a little more oomph,
but I was grateful that they were easier to chew than classic Skittles.

## Texture

Texture was a mixed bag.
The shells of these jelly beans are not very smooth at all,
but they are a good thickness in proportion to the insides.
Unfortunately, the shell doesn't break up into nice hunks,
but falls apart quickly. The insides good and smooth, though!

Daniel's thoughts: "Pretty smooth and homogenous.
I only notice any grain when thinking about it,
and they're less grainy than I remember Skittles themselves being."

## Taste and flavor

<div class="inset">
    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:strawberry: Strawberry</li>
        <li>:orange: Orange</li>
        <li>:lemon: Lemon</li>
        <li>:green_heart: Lime</li>
        <li>:grapes: Grape</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Skittles Jelly Beans feature the same five flavors as the original candies,
and they match them pretty well.

Strawberry is the most Skittle-like, classic flavor, and our favorite overall.
We found orange to be a very good orange, as artificial orange flavors go.
Grape was pretty decent, too.
Lemon and lime are weakest of the bunch – "Wholly disappointing," Daniel says.
They lacked the acidity that we both thought necessary for these flavors.
He also thought the lime was so weak that it just tasted like refined sugar.

I also note that there was some significant variation
between beans of the same flavor, particularly in intensity of flavor.

It's a very mediocre batch of flavors, overall.

**5 out of 10 beans**


## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

Daniel compared the one-of-each experience to
"tearing open a fun-size bag of Skittles and dumping them all in your mouth,"
but easier to chew, and I found that to be an apt comparison.
After a few seconds, it turns into a monoflavor experience, for the most part,
but it definitely brings back memories of the same classic Skittles monoflavor.

**7 out of 10 beans**


## Conclusion

This is a decent bag if you like Skittles and also find them too hard to chew,
but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend them very highly.

Thanks again to guest panelist Daniel! It was great to review these with you,
and I hope we can do it again next year.
