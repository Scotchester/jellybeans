Here's a little capsule review for you
as we head into the final stretch this weekend.

This one harkens back to
[last season's revelation](/trader-joes-sour-jelly-beans)
that both of this site's top two all-time scorers (at 30 out of 35 beans),
[Trader Joe's](/trader-joes-gourmet-jelly-beans) and
[Waterbridge](/waterbridge-gourmet-jelly-beans),
are manufactured by The Jelly Bean Factory, an Irish company.

Today's brand, Crazy Candy Co., is the house brand for the grocery chain
[Aldi](https://www.aldi.us/), and Aldi, as it happens, is
[a sort of cousin to Trader Joe's](https://www.tastingtable.com/910536/the-connection-between-trader-joes-and-aldi/).
Is it any surprise, then, that these are also manufactured in Ireland
and share many overlapping flavors with Trader Joe's and Waterbridge's
gourmet flavor selections?

The physical characteristics are identical, of course,
so refer back to the previous reviews (linked above)
if you want details on those.
The officialc category ratings match those prior ones, as well.

I've included the list of flavors over there so you can see
what flavors come in the Aldi package,
[and I've also made a spreadsheet comparing the flavor selection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pvb1lt7iOpYJGnKAVaHWvVKVfCcxv3LYNDgetlFVLkA/edit?usp=sharing)
across all three of the products manufactured by Jelly Bean Factory
that I've been able to try thus far,
so if you have access to both Trader Joe's and Aldi,
you can choose the set you prefer.
Of course, if you're in Canada or willing to order from there,
you can just get the Waterbridge set, which has them all.
