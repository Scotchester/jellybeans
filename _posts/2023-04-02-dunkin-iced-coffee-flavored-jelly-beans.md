Baseball season has kicked off,
and that means jelly bean season is coming to a close.
We have one final week remaining, and to start that week off
we have another big release from last year that I'm finally getting around to:
Dunkin’ Iced Coffee Flavored Jelly Beans!

I love coffee and espresso-based beverages of all kinds,
but I usually don't like them to be very sweet,
so I am not an avid drinker of Dunkin’s usual sugary concoctions.
I may not be able to fairly judge how well these beans replicate those drinks,
but all of the named flavors are familiar, so let's see how they fare.


## Size and shape

These beans are fairly average for a mass-market jelly bean
where the focus is on the brand that is known for a different product.
The mean size is just about perfect,
but the standard deviation is larger than it should be.
There is a half-hearted attempt at making a bean shape instead of an egg,
but it's not an elegant dimple by any stretch of the imagination.
Finally, several beans are missing significant areas of their shells.
Overall, they are not bad, but they're not especially good, either.

## Chewability

Most of these beans strike a pretty good balance between ease of chewing
and having some substance into which to sink one's teeth,
but there are more than a few outliers that offer a bit too much resistance.

## Texture

These beans have a classic texture profile, with a substantial shell
that doesn't overpower the insides and a generally pleasing smoothness
throughout both components.
The only nitpick I'll offer here is that the shell falls apart too easily.

## Taste and flavor

    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:fire: :palm_tree: Toasted Coconut</li>
        <li>:b: :parking: Butter Pecan</li>
        <li>:fr: :ice_cream: French Vanilla</li>
        <li>:candy: :milk_glass: Caramel Latte</li>
        <li>:chestnut: Hazelnut</li>
    </ul>
</div>

I'm not a fan of coconut, as you may recall,
so Toasted Coconut is my least favorite here,
but for those who like coconut, I think you'll find it's a solid melding of
that with the classic toasted marshmallow flavor that Jelly Belly made famous.
Butter Pecan also harkens back to a Jelly Belly classic,
buttered popcorn, with butter being the predominant flavor.
It's hard to clearly tasted the pecan flavor, but hey,
that's also true of the real life nut it's based on.

French Vanilla is a solid classic, with a hint of coffee
to differentiate it from a basic French vanilla jelly bean.
Hazelnut is a really good rendition of that classic coffee flavoring.
Rounding out the bunch, Caramel Latte is fine, but unremarkable.

While I only really noticed the coffee aspect in the French Vanilla bean,
this is still a pretty decent collection of flavors that are dessert-adjacent,
much like the flavors of Dunkin’s iced coffee lineup.

## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

All of these flavors work quite well together
and aren't too tough to handle as a mouthful of five.
The flavors remain pretty distinctly identifiable,
and a prominent coffee overtone rises to the forefront.
It's a great way to consume these beans!

**9 out of 10 beans**


## Conclusion

Dunkin’ delivers a demonstrably delicious set of jelly beans here,
and I would absolutely recommend them to anyone who enjoys coffee
or the dessert-ish flavors with which they imbue their signature beverage!
