Surprise! It's another Brach's Tiny Jelly Bird Eggs review.
You're probably wondering why I would subject myself to that again,
and the answer is because you just never know until you try something.
_These_ Tiny Jelly Bird Eggs are actually pretty good,
and the Brach's story takes another surprising turn.

Comparing the Fruit Fusions bag under review today with
[yesterday's Purple Rain variety](/brachs-purple-rain-tiny-jelly-bird-eggs),
the similarities are striking.
- They have nearly identical packaging, in terms of layout.
- They are both manufactured in Mexico.
- The nutrition facts are _almost_ the same –
  a serving of Fruit Fusions beans has 10 mg of Sodium,
  compared to 5 mg in the Purple Rain beans.

And yet, the Fruit Fusions jelly beans are undeniably just better.
Let's get into it.


## Size and shape

For whatever reason, the Fruit Fusions Tiny Jelly Bird Eggs
are much more consistent in their size and shape than the
[Purple Rains](/brachs-purple-rain-tiny-jelly-bird-eggs#size-and-shape).
The size variance is much smaller, and the average size is dead on.
Shape is also improved, with surfaces that are smoother,
fewer pockmarks and protrusions, and better egg-like roundness.

## Chewability

The chewability of these beans also improves slightly on the
[Purple Rain beans](/brachs-purple-rain-tiny-jelly-bird-eggs#chewability).
I'm not sure it should get a perfect 5, but I did rate the Purple Rains a 4,
which I don't want to go back on, and these are definitely better than those.
They have a bit more of the resistance I look for, mostly in the insides.

## Texture

The texture category is another small improvement.
The shell is just a little more substantial,
and the insides are less fluffy.

At this point, I'm really struggling to believe that these use
the same process or ingredients as other Jelly Bird Eggs.
These to seem to more closely resemble the products
that Brach's labels Jelly _Beans_.
I really have no idea what's going on.

## Taste and flavor

<div class="inset">
    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:green_apple: Apple</li>
        <li>:orange: Orange</li>
        <li>:grapes: Grape</li>
        <li>:cherries: Cherry</li>
        <li>:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: Raspberry</li>
    </ul>
</div>

I keep singing the same song, category after category,
about how much these Fruit Fusions beans are improving on
[the Purple Rain beans](/brachs-purple-rain-tiny-jelly-bird-eggs#taste-and-flavor),
but in this category, the improvement is more than slight.
These "five speckled fruity flavors with a hint of cranberry"
are _way_ better.

For starters, the predominant taste is not white sugar.
That's already a good sign.
Second, the fruit flavors are bolder, overall.
Apple and grape are subtler than the other three,
but both are still more present
than any of the flavors in the Purple Rain package.
Each flavor pretty clearly tastes like what it should, as well,
even if they're not amazingly accurate.
And I like the little zings that the "hint of cranberry"
provides from time to time.
I wish that was present on more of the beans in the bag.

I'm glad to see that these beans taste actually _good_.
Maybe not _great_, but good.

**6 out of 10 beans**


## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

These five beans do well taken together, too.
Five average-sized beans is the right volume for a good, but safe mouthful.
The white sugar comes out front a little bit,
but the fruit flavors don't get lost.
It's not lighting my world on fire, but it's not bad.

**5 out of 10 beans**


## Conclusion

Category         | Score
---------------- | ---------------
Size and shape   | **4**/5 beans
Chewability      | **5**/5 beans
Texture          | **4**/5 beans
Taste and flavor | **6**/10 beans
One-of-each test | **5**/10 beans
---------------- | ---------------
_Total_          | **24**/35 beans

Well, I'll be. A bag of Brach's Jelly Bird Eggs cracked 20! And eclipsed
[the Purple Rain set's 14 total beans](/brachs-purple-rain-tiny-jelly-bird-eggs#conclusion)
by _ten!_ I am flabbergasted.

Like the Brach's Jelly Beans that I reviewed positively,
I would actually finish this whole bag if I didn't have more to review
before the season is out!
I still feel like there's a missing link in
my understanding of Brach's strategy,
but I'll take whatever positive outcomes I can get.
