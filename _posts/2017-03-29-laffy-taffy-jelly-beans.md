Sorry for the two week gap during the season.
If you follow me on Twitter, you may have seen that
I'm not super excited to be writing this review,
and when I'm not enjoying the beans,
it's easy to procrastinate writing the review.

I will also state up front that Laffy Taffy
has never been one of my favorite candies in its original form,
so I came into this with low expectations.
That may be unfairly biasing this review,
but I will do my best to make it as objective as possible.

One other mildly amusing thing to note before we begin:
I can't figure out why Laffy Taffy felt the need to
include the word "flavored" on their packaging.
Isn't that obviously implied?


## Size and shape

![Animation of a dumpster fire]({{ site.url }}/static/img/dumpster-fire.gif)

To keep myself sane and this review mercifully short,
I'll just bullet-point this:

- Too small overall, with some bad outliers in size
- Too flat in overall shape; surfaces aren't very mooth
- No dimple
- Too many double beans
- No redeeming qualities in this category

**0 out of 5 beans**


## Chewability

The smaller size contributes positiviely to chewability,
but that's mainly a benefit because it's overcoming the
overly stiff and thick shell.

Could be worse.

## Texture

Once bitten into, the texture reveals itself to be
the one quality of these jelly beans that stands out positively.
(Not that that's saying a whole lot.)
The shell breaks down very smoothly, resulting in a creaminess
that is reminiscent of the current regining champ,
[SweeTarts Jelly Beans](/sweetarts-jelly-beans).

The insides are a little on the light side,
and they do develop into a sort of cheap bubble-gum like consistency
after a little bit of chewing, which isn't all that pleasant.

Still, a good category for the Laffy Taffy beans.

## Taste and flavor

<div class="inset">
    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:banana: Banana</li>
        <li>:cherries: Cherry</li>
        <li>:grapes: Grape</li>
        <li>:green_apple: Apple</li>
    </ul>
</div>

While I applaud Laffy Taffy for faithfully the core flavors
that their original taffy is known for,
it's a shame those flavors don't actually taste good.
The banana, in particular, is very accurate to my memory of banana Laffy Taffy.
It just happens to be a terrible flavor, as most artificial bananas are.
As noted in the previous review,
[Starburst Crazy Beans](/starburst-crazy-beans)
offer a _good_ example of a banana flavor.

Another bone to pick: the green apple in traditional Laffy Taffy
is actually _sour apple_.
Why make it a not-sour apple in the jelly beans?
At least one flavor in this bag could use that pop.
All of the flavors are rather bland, in general.

**3 out of 10 beans**


## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

Despite the thick shells, it's fairly easy to eat four of these jelly beans,
given their petite size.
The blandness of the individual flavors causes the combined taste
to be even more boring, though.
It quickly becomes impossible to pick out any single flavor.
The banana seems to take over, actually.
That's the main impression I'm left with when swallowing.

## Conclusion

Category         | Score
---------------- | ---------------
Size and shape   | **0**/5 beans
Chewability      | **2**/5 beans
Texture          | **3**/5 beans
Taste and flavor | **3**/10 beans
One-of-each test | **3**/10 beans
---------------- | ---------------
_Total_          | **11**/35 beans

Congratulations, Laffy Taffy;
at the very least, you beat out the two worst scoring beans to date,
[Russell Stover Pectin Jelly Beans](/russell-stover-pectin-jelly-beans) and
[Brach's Classic Jelly Bird Eggs](/brachs-classic-jelly-bird-eggs).

Onto something hopefully tastier for the next review!
