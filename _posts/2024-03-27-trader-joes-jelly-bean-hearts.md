I have a little capsule review to offer today, for a little seasonal package
from our current king of the hill, Trader Joe's.
Thanks again to Daniel for sending these to me!

This is a cute little bag that is put out around Valentine's Day,
which consists of four different flavors: cherry, raspberry, strawberry,
and (sadly) coconut.
As the name indicates,
they eschew a traditional jelly bean shape in favor of a heart shape.
Well, A heart-_ish_ shape.
It's more of a "puffy right angle" than a traditional heart,
whose point has an acute angle.

This set is made by the same Irish candymaker as the previous beans
we've reviewed from the Trader Joe's corporate family
([Trader Joe's Gourmet](/trader-joes-gourmet-jelly-beans),
[Trader Joe's Sour](/trader-joes-sour-jelly-beans), and
[the Aldi chain's Crazy Candy Co. beans](crazy-candy-co-gourmet-jelly-beans)),
so chewability and texture naturally fall right in line with those reviews,
and the flavors are all ones covered before, as well.
As such, I'm not doing the full category-by-category breakdown,
but I wanted to put out this capsule review
to remind folks of how great everything coming out of
[The Jelly Bean Factory](https://thejellybeanfactory.com/) in Ireland
(including Canadian brand [Waterbridge](/waterbridge-gourmet-jelly-beans))
is worth buying every time you see them!
