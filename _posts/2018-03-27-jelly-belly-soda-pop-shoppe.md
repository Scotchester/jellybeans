We're heading back to the jolly land of Jelly Belly for this review,
taking a look at their collection of soda-inspired flavors.
We'll probably be reviewing Jelly Belly packages
with increasing frequency, given how prolific they are compared to most brands.

Jelly Belly puts out a lot of interesting and unusual flavors.
This is a fun little bundle of beans that are
actually inspired by real-life soda flavors like
Dr. Pepper (one of my all-time favorites) and 7 Up.

I'm going to refer you to the Jelly Belly [Snapple](/jelly-belly-snapple)
and [Sours](/jelly-belly-sours) reviews
for details on the first three categories.
Jelly Belly is just so consistent, they're not worth rehashing here.


## Size and shape

## Chewability

## Texture

## Taste and flavor

    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:orange: Orange Crush</li>
        <li>:beer: A&W Root Beer</li>
        <li>:syringe: Dr. Pepper</li>
        <li>:green_heart: 7 Up</li>
        <li>:icecream: A&W Cream Soda</li>
        <li>:grapes: Grape Crush</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Now the fun begins! Jelly Belly truly does an incredible job
capturing the essence of the original soda flavors.

- Orange and Grape Crush could easily
  reuse existing Jelly Belly orange and grape flavors,
  but no. They clearly put an effort into
  making them taste like the specific
  orange and grape flavors of Crush.
- Maybe it's psychosomatic, but it seems like
  there's an effervescence to the 7 Up flavor,
  which emulates the lemon/lime combo of the soda very well.
- A&W Root Beer and Cream Soda taste like they should,
  and Dr. Pepper is one of my favorite flavors
  since I first discovered Jelly Belly,
  going back well over a decade.

This is a delightful diversion from the typical
rainbow of fruit flavors comprising the lineup
of most jelly bean packages.

## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

If you're familiar with the standard disclaimer from the above footnote,
you might be wondering how I'm going to approach this.
Do Dr. Pepper, Root Beer, and Cream Soda
get disqualified for not being fruit flavors?

In the spirit of the classic "suicide" sodas of my youth,
I will indeed include all of the flavors in this test.

Andâ€¦ it's not bad! Each of the flavors
is distinctly present in the resulting mixture, though I would say that
Root Beer and Dr. Pepper come through most clearly.
7 Up and Orange Crush add brightness, Grape Crush adds depth.
Cream Soda is probably the one least pulling its weight.

Standard caveat about the ding this category takes
due to Jelly Belly's chewability applies.

[^1]: This test is specific to fruit flavors _only_. While non-fruit flavors like licorice or buttered popcorn may be welcome, they are exempt from this test. Because that's just nasty.
