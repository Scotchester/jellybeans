Today we take a look at one of the big new releases from last season,
Froot Loops Jelly Beans!

Froot Loops were not one of my _favorite_ cereals growing up,
but we had them once in a while.
Let's see if they can trigger any waves of nostalgia,
or at the very least, some tastebud tingles.


## Size and shape

At first glance, these immediately bear a striking resemblance to
[Starburst Jelly Beans](/starburst-jelly-beans).
They have the same slightly-smaller-than-average size,
they are similarly oblong with no dimple,
and they also have very good consistency across the bag.
Those first two points together are worth knocking a bean off,
but it's a very appealing visual presentation on the whole.

## Chewability

Biting into these jelly beans further cements my suspicion that
they share a common heritage with Starburst Jelly Beans,
because these Froot Loops beans seem to chew identically
to how I remember Starburst beans chewing â€“
which is to say, perfectly.

## Texture

Here again, the Starburst similarities continue:
we have a very smooth shell of adequate thickness
and smooth (but not perfectly so) insides.
The shell could hold together into better chunks,
but this is another strong category.

At this point, I am prepared to assert that these are exactly the same
as Starburst Jelly Beans, but with different flavors.
Of course, that makes "How do they taste?" the question of the day.


## Taste and flavor

<div class="inset">
    <h3>Flavors</h3>
    <ul class="emoji-list">
        <li>:red_circle: Red</li>
        <li>:orange: Orange</li>
        <li>:lemon: Lemon</li>
        <li>:green_heart: Lime</li>
        <li>:grapes: Grape</li>
        <li>:large_blue_circle: Blue</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Unfortunately, the answer to that question is "not great".

One interesting thing to note is that, like other common fruit-flavored cereals,
[Froot Loops cereal has only one flavor](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/are-all-froot-loops-the-same-flavor/),
despite having loops of different colors.
Froot Loops _Jelly Beans_, however, definitely have distinct flavors,
even if the distinctions are incredibly subtle.
The packaging gives no indication of what the intended flavors are,
and they are so bland that I can't even be sure
what the red and blue beans are meant to represent
(probably cherry or strawberry and blueberry or blue raspberry, respectively).

All of the flavors bear a certain lactic quality,
which I will consider a successful attempt to conjure up
the impression of a bowl of cereal as you eat these.

As stated, though, these are just not that interesting or tasty.

## The one-of-each test

Perhaps the ultimate test of a bag of jelly beans is how enjoyable it is
to take one of each flavor and eat them all at the same time.[^1]

Fortunately, the physical characteristics inherited from Starburst
make chewing six of these beans a relatively manageable task.
Unfortunately, there is just no flavor separation,
given how close the flavors already are to one another.

**5 out of 10 beans**


## Conclusion

I suspect we'll continue to see a new entry from an established brand
into the jelly bean field every year, but mediocre efforts like this one
just feel like a cash grab, sadly.
